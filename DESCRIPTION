Description: 
    Implements Generalized Information Criterion (GIC) for variable selection in 
    High-dimensions using Hopfield network optimization. The computationally intensive  
    components are implemented in Julia for performance, while providing an R interface for
    ease of use. Supports various GLMs including Normal, Poisson and 
    others. The package automatically handles Julia installation and provides
    comprehensive documentation with examples.
