To use the GICHighDimension package:

1. Install Julia (version >= 1.9.0) from https://julialang.org/downloads/

2. From within R, initialize the Julia environment manually:
   library(GICHighDimension)
   setup_julia(install_julia = FALSE)

3. Then install the required Julia packages:
   install_julia_packages()

Note:
- These steps should be done interactively by the user.
- The package does NOT install Julia or its packages automatically.
- No installation actions are triggered during CRAN checks, tests, or vignettes.
